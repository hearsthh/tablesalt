Custom Requirements: ${customPrompt}

CONTENT TO PROCESS:
${extractedText}

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
1. EXTRACT EVERY SINGLE ITEM - Miss nothing, even if formatting is inconsistent
2. PRESERVE EXACT PRICES - Convert currency symbols to numbers (₹450 → 450, Rs.120 → 120)
3. MAINTAIN ORIGINAL NAMES - Use exact item names as written
4. CREATE APPETIZING DESCRIPTIONS - ${descriptionGuidelines[descriptionStyle as keyof typeof descriptionGuidelines]}
5. INTELLIGENT TAG ASSIGNMENT - Use selected tags: ${selectedTags.join(", ")}

DESCRIPTION ENHANCEMENT RULES:
- Style: ${descriptionStyle}
- ${descriptionGuidelines[descriptionStyle as keyof typeof descriptionGuidelines]}
- Make descriptions mouth-watering and sales-focused

- Handle multiple price formats: ₹, Rs, INR, numbers only
- Detect combo meals, family packs, portion sizes
- Extract allergen information if present
- Handle multilingual content (Hindi/English mix)

PRICING INTELLIGENCE:
- If prices missing, suggest realistic ${cuisine} restaurant prices for Indian market

- Ensure no duplicate items
- Check price reasonableness
- Validate dietary classifications
- Assign appropriate tags from selected list

CUSTOM REQUIREMENTS:
${customPrompt || "Focus on creating an appealing menu that drives sales"}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- extractionConfidence: 0-100 based on text quality and completeness
- extractedItemsCount: Total items found
- processingNotes: Any issues or assumptions made
- Complete category structure with all items properly organized
- Rich, appetizing descriptions for every item
- Strategic tag distribution using selected tags
